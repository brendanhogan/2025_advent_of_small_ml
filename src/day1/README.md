# Day 1 - Reading List

![Day 1 Header](day1.jpeg)

## Overview

Over the last couple of months, I've bookmarked hundreds of papers, repos, and startup ideas. I used today as a forcing function to process the backlog: I went through them all, filtered out the noise, and condensed them into a single list of the top ~80.

Everything included is noteworthy, but I've added tiered ratings and my own notes to each one.

(I'm thinking of making this a monthly post/substack, a ranked list of papers alongside the high level trends of where I see things moving. Weekly was a bit much, but monthly feels right).

**Note:** Day 24 will cover the end-of-year catch-up. This covers July → early November.
