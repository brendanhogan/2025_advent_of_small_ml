      "title": "Safety Alignment Should be Made More Than Just a Few Tokens Deep",
      "abstract": "The safety alignment of current Large Language Models (LLMs) is vulnerable. Simple attacks, or even benign fine-tuning, can jailbreak aligned models. We note that many of these vulnerabilities are related to a shared underlying issue: safety alignment can take shortcuts, wherein the alignment adapts a model's generative distribution primarily over only its very first few output tokens. We unifiedly refer to this issue as shallow safety alignment. In this paper, we present case studies to explain why shallow safety alignment can exist and show how this issue universally contributes to multiple recently discovered vulnerabilities in LLMs, including the susceptibility to adversarial suffix attacks, prefilling attacks, decoding parameter attacks, and fine-tuning attacks. The key contribution of this work is that we demonstrate how this consolidated notion of shallow safety alignment sheds light on promising research directions for mitigating these vulnerabilities. We show that deepening the safety alignment beyond the first few tokens can meaningfully improve robustness against some common exploits. We also design a regularized fine-tuning objective that makes the safety alignment more persistent against fine-tuning attacks by constraining updates on initial tokens. Overall, we advocate that future safety alignment should be made more than just a few tokens deep."

      "title": "Roll the dice & look before you leap: Going beyond the creative limits of next-token prediction",
      "abstract": "We design a suite of minimal algorithmic tasks that are a loose abstraction of open-ended real-world tasks. This allows us to cleanly and controllably quantify the creative limits of the present-day language model. Much like real-world tasks that require a creative, far-sighted leap of thought, our tasks require an implicit, open-ended stochastic planning step that either (a) discovers new connections in an abstract knowledge graph (like in wordplay, drawing analogies, or research) or (b) constructs new patterns (like in designing math problems or new proteins). In these tasks, we empirically and conceptually argue how next-token learning is myopic; multi-token approaches, namely teacherless training and diffusion models, comparatively excel in producing diverse and original output. Secondly, to elicit randomness without hurting coherence, we find that injecting noise at the input layer (dubbed seed-conditioning) works surprisingly as well as (and in some conditions, better than) temperature sampling from the output layer. Thus, our work offers a principled, minimal test-bed for analyzing open-ended creative skills, and offers new arguments for going beyond next-token learning and temperature sampling. We make part of the code available under this https URL"

      "title": "Visual Autoregressive Modeling: Scalable Image Generation via Next-Scale Prediction",
      "abstract": "We present Visual AutoRegressive modeling (VAR), a new generation paradigm that redefines the autoregressive learning on images as coarse-to-fine next-scale prediction or next-resolution prediction, diverging from the standard raster-scan next-token prediction. This simple, intuitive methodology allows autoregressive (AR) transformers to learn visual distributions fast and generalize well: VAR, for the first time, makes GPT-like AR models surpass diffusion transformers in image generation. On ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VAR significantly improve AR baseline by improving Frechet inception distance (FID) from 18.65 to 1.73, inception score (IS) from 80.4 to 350.2, with around 20x faster inference speed. It is also empirically verified that VAR outperforms the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) in multiple dimensions including image quality, inference speed, data efficiency, and scalability. Scaling up VAR models exhibits clear power-law scaling laws similar to those observed in LLMs, with linear correlation coefficients near -0.998 as solid evidence. VAR further showcases zero-shot generalization ability in downstream tasks including image in-painting, out-painting, and editing. These results suggest VAR has initially emulated the two important properties of LLMs: Scaling Laws and zero-shot task generalization. We have released all models and codes to promote the exploration of AR/VAR models for visual generation and unified learning."

      "title": "Stochastic Taylor Derivative Estimator: Efficient amortization for arbitrary differential operators",
      "abstract": "Optimizing neural networks with loss that contain high-dimensional and high-order differential operators is expensive to evaluate with back-propagation due to \ue23b(dk) scaling of the derivative tensor size and the \ue23b(2k\u22121L) scaling in the computation graph, where d is the dimension of the domain, L is the number of ops in the forward computation graph, and k is the derivative order. In previous works, the polynomial scaling in d was addressed by amortizing the computation over the optimization process via randomization. Separately, the exponential scaling in k for univariate functions (d=1) was addressed with high-order auto-differentiation (AD). In this work, we show how to efficiently perform arbitrary contraction of the derivative tensor of arbitrary order for multivariate functions, by properly constructing the input tangents to univariate high-order AD, which can be used to efficiently randomize any differential operator. When applied to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), our method provides >1000\u00d7 speed-up and >30\u00d7 memory reduction over randomization with first-order AD, and we can now solve emph{1-million-dimensional PDEs in 8 minutes on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU}. This work opens the possibility of using high-order differential operators in large-scale problems."
